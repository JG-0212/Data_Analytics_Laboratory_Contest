## Resources for the competition

- [skmultilearn](http://scikit.ml/) is a library with packages containing various algorithms for multi label classification
- (https://xang1234.github.io/multi-label/) illustrates basic usage of skmultilearn
- (https://xang1234.github.io/fastxml/) just a follow up to the previous post
- (https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-label-classification-with-deep-learning/) uses neural networks and not the standard ML algorithms
- (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-label_classification) customary wiki page
- (https://towardsdatascience.com/journey-to-the-center-of-multi-label-classification-384c40229bff) contains data pre processing steps
- (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260719311745) literally the same problem statement, maybe can borrow the literature review
- (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365723001768) similar paper
- (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365724002094) and one more
- (https://www.sciencedirect.com/search?qs=icd%2010%20multi%20label%20classification) for more papers, if enthu exists
