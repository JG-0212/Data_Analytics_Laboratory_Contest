# ICD-10 Multi Label Classification Contest
---

# Description

The contest was part of the course evaluation for the course Data Analytics Laboratory where we were tasked to perform multi label classification of ICD-10 diseases based on GatorTron embeddings. The problem was attempted with a novel approach of a 2-stage classification - first the letter and then the labels which start with the letter reducing the label space by 4 times. A micro-F1 score of 0.461 was achieved.
